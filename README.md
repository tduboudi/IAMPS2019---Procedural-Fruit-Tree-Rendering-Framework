# IAMPS2019-Procedural-Fruit-Tree-Rendering-Framework

Code to accompany the IAMPS 2019 paper "Toward a procedural fruit tree rendering framework for image analysis"

Authors : Thomas Duboudin, Sridhar Ragupathi, Maxime Petit, Liming Chen

This code allows you to reproduce the results of the IAMPS 2019 paper "Toward a procedural fruit tree rendering framework for image analysis". To get it to work, you will need to get the additional files, such as textures and 3D models and put them in the correct folder.

To use the source code :

1 - Download and install Blender (https://www.blender.org/). We recommand using Blender 2.78c instead of Blender 2.79b (the latest as of 27/06/19) as we had problems getting the GPU-rendering to work with the latest version and a GTX NVIDIA 1080. To enable GPU-rendering, follow this link : https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.html.

2 - Install the Blender Add-on "Sapling Tree Gen". To do so, go to "File" -> "User preferences" -> "Add-ons" and search for "Sapling Tree Gen" in the research toolbar.

3 - Download the textures and additional files from the following links and put them in the corresponding folder :

-- HDRIs (360Â° high-resolution background image) : https://hdrihaven.com/

-- Leaves textures :

-- Bark texture : 

-- Fruit texture :

-- Fruit 3D models :
